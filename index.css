/*
very much a todo in progress

idea is something like instagram web/mobile,
some initial controls at the top and a logo which is auto-playing animation of 'autotoon' being drawn

then the main frame will be filled with whatever image user picks

at bottom has some rendering style and playback options
for rendering style, i.e. sharpness/bluriness: https://codepen.io/FelixRilling/pen/avRpKq
